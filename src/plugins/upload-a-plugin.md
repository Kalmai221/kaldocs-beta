# Publish your work
Want to publish your plugin to our [Showcase](https://discordsource.com/plugins/)? Follow these instructions slow & carefully.

## Steps
I promise it doesn't take long :)

1. [Create a new file](https://github.com/MrRobotjs/BetterDocs-React/new/master/src/plugins)
2. The name of the file is **required** to match your plugin name.
    > Make sure it's a markdown file `.md` and that it's [Kebab Case style](http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase). `[REQUIRED]`
3. Use the following template to ensure required fields are filled:
```md
